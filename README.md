Git clone with submodules

The list of steps required to clone a Git repository with submodules is:

    Issue a git clone command on the parent repository.
    Issue a git submodule init command.
    Issue a git submodule update command.

Git init and update alternative

There is actually an alternative to going through these three steps. You can use the â€“recurse-submodules switch on the clone. This approach, shown below, might be easier.
